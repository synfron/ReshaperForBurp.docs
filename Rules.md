# Rules

Rules allow you to set actions to perform (called Thens) if an HTTP or WebSocket message (event) received by Burp Suite meets certain criteria (called Whens). Rules are processed in order. If the Rule is set to `Auto-Run`, the Rule will be run automatically when an HTTP or WebSocket event is received, otherwise, it must be specifically triggered. Rules must be `Enabled` to run at all.

HTTP events are processed by Rules under the HTTP Rules tab. WebSocket events are processed by Rules under the WebSocket Rules tab.

Note: HTTP message values that are accessible by WebSocket Rule operations refer to components of the originating ws:// or wss:// request that triggered the establishment of the WebSocket connection.

If the relevant value does not match the constraints of the When (opposite if `Negate Result` is selected), unless the following When has specified to `Use OR Condition`, no further Whens are processed for the current Rule and all Thens are skipped.

If this When reports success, the failure of the previous When is ignored.

Negate Result - If checked, a successful match will be reported as a failure, and an unsuccessful match will be reported as a success.

### Set List Variable

The following fields are only available if the variable source is a list variant.

Item Placement - `First`: Set/overwrite the first item in the list; `Last`: Set/overwrite the last item in the list; `Index`: Set/overwrite zero-based Nth item of the list; `Add First`: Insert as the first item in the list; `Add Last`: Insert as the last item in the list; `All`: Reset the list with a new delimited value;

### Other Fields

Auto-Run - If checked, the Rule will be evaluated for every event Reshaper is enabled to handle. If unchecked, the Rule will only run if explicitly triggered by a Then Run Rule.

Enabled - If unchecked, the Rule is marked inactive and will not be evaluated under any condition.

Save - Any changes to Rules in the UI do not become live and are not persisted until the Save button is clicked. Upon hitting the Save button, all fields are validated to ensure value requirements are met. If validation issues are found, details of the issues are displayed, and the changes will remain unsaved.

## Debugging

Rules can be debugged by enabling event diagnostics (_Settings > General > Enable Event Diagnostics_) to debug all Rules or by right-clicking the specific Rules you want to debug in the Rules list and selecting `Toggle Debug Logging` in the context menu. This will log details about the actions the Rule(s) have taken for each event (request, response, or WebSocket message) processed, including the result of When constraint checks, and the values that were used in Whens and Thens.

Example Diagnostic Output:

```
Request: http://example.com/
	Rule: Test
		    When Event Direction('Request' equals 'Request') - PASS
		AND When Matches Text('example.com' contains 'example') - PASS
		    Then Set Value(destinationMessageValue='Request Header' destinationIdentifier='special' input='Mine')
		    Then Highlight('orange')
	End Rule
End Request

Response: http://example.com/
	Rule: Test
		    When Event Direction('Response' equals 'Request') - FAIL
	End Rule
End Response
```
